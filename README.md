# Coupons System Spring Backend

This is the server side of the Spring Boot application made for coupons managment.\
Access to the system is divided into three types of clients: Administrator, Company, and Customer.\
The administrator can add different companies and create a user for them to login independently.\
Every company can generate itself coupons and decide their details like amount, price, start date, end date and more.\
Customers can register themselfs to the system and purchase the companies' couopns.\
Each client is able to login to the system and execute specific operations.\

Development inviroment that I used is IntelliJ IDEA.

This is the backend of the final project in the Java Full-Stack course at John Bryce Academy.
