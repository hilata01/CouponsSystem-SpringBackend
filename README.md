# Coupons System Spring Backend

This is the server-side of the Spring Boot application made for coupons management.\
Access to the system is divided into three types of clients: Administrator, Company, and Customer.\
The administrator can add different companies and create a user for them to log in independently.\
Every company can generate coupons and decide their details like amount, price, start date, end date, and more.\
Customers can register themselves to the system and purchase the companies' coupons.\
Each client can log in to the system and execute specific operations.

The development environment that I used is IntelliJ IDEA.

This is the backend of the final project in the Java Full-Stack course at John Bryce Academy.
